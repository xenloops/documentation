# Technical documentation best practices

Moving documentation to a Confluence-style intranet site involves more than just a file transfer; it's about structuring and presenting information effectively for optimal access and understanding. Following are some best practices for the migration and organization of documentation on a Confluence-style intranet:

## Plan the Information Architecture

* Define Categories and Spaces: Group related content into categories and create dedicated spaces for different teams or departments.
* Create a Clear Hierarchy: Establish a logical hierarchy for pages and subpages to make navigation intuitive.

## Engage Stakeholders

* Collaborate with Teams: Involve different teams to understand their documentation needs and preferences
* Gather Input: Collect feedback on the existing documentation and incorporate suggestions for improvement.

## Standardize Templates

* Use Consistent Templates: Develop standardized templates for various types of documentation (e.g., procedures, guidelines, FAQs) to maintain a consistent look and feel.
* Include Metadata: Add relevant metadata, such as document owner, creation date, and last update, to enhance searchability and traceability.

## Optimize Searchability

* Implement a Tagging System: Use tags to enhance search functionality and make it easier for users to find relevant content
* Use Descriptive Titles and Headings: Craft titles and headings that accurately reflect the content of the page for improved discoverability.
* Link information/documents outside the current document referred to.

## Encourage Collaboration

* Enable Comments and Feedback: Allow users to leave comments and provide feedback on documentation to encourage collaboration and continuous improvement.
* Integrate with Collaboration Tools: If possible, integrate Confluence with other collaboration tools, such as Jira or Slack, to streamline communication.

## Version Control

* Implement Versioning: Enable version control for documents to track changes and maintain a history of revisions.
* Communicate Changes: Clearly communicate changes to users, especially if there are updates that might impact their work.

## Use Visuals Effectively

* Incorporate Images and Diagrams: Enhance understanding by incorporating visuals like images, diagrams, and charts.
* Leverage Formatting: Use formatting features like bullet points, tables, and color coding to make the content visually appealing and digestible.

## Maintenance

* Establish Ownership: Assign ownership of documentation to specific individuals or teams to ensure accountability.
* Schedule Reviews: Regularly review and update documentation to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Train Users

* Provide Training Sessions: Conduct training sessions for users to familiarize them with the new intranet and its features.
* Create User Guides: Develop user guides or tutorials to help users navigate and leverage the features of the Confluence-style intranet.

## Accessibility

* Ensure Accessibility Standards: Design the intranet with accessibility standards in mind to accommodate users with diverse needs.
* Test for Usability: Conduct usability testing to identify and address any accessibility challenges.

## Backup and Recovery

* Implement Regular Backups: Ensure that there are regular backups of the Confluence data to prevent data loss.
* Document Recovery Procedures: Document procedures for data recovery in case of unexpected issues.
